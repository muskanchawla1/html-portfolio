    <p>First paragraph.The biggest revolution in the history of communication is Social Media and this started a completely 
    new era altogether.Every platform that enables us to communicate and socialize locally and globally
    is a Social media platform. Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram and Whatsapp are its many avatars.
    </p>
    <p>Second paragraph.Social media allows us to fellowship with people from all corners of the world. It gives us a sense
    of a global community where we are no more divided by political powers but united by our thoughts
    and interests. We can always keep in touch with people from all walks of our life â€“ a boon that 
    seemed impossible until social media showed up.
    </p>
    <p>Third paragraph.It gives the common man a platform to voice with complete freedom of expression, be it for 
    supporting a cause or for addressing a national or international issue of any sensitivity.
    Business prospects and job opportunities gear up as social media is a stage with global audience 
    to showcase our talents.
